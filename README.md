House Price Prediction

Develop a machine learning model using a housing dataset to predict house prices based on features. 
like square footage and number of bedrooms.
Preprocess the data to handle missing values and scale numerical features.
Train the model using regression techniques such as Linear Regression or Decision Trees.
Evaluate its accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error on test data to ensure reliable predictions.\
This model aims to assist in estimating house prices accurately for new properties.
